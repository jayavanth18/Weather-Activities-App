# Weather & Activities App üå§Ô∏è

#### Video Demo:  [Watch the Demo](https://youtu.be/h_1Ll4w68Gs)

#### Description:
The Weather & Activities App is a Python-based command-line tool that helps users check current weather and receive personalized activity suggestions based on real-time conditions. By entering a city name, the app fetches weather data using the Open-Meteo API and approximates the local time using a simple mathematical formula derived from longitude. This makes it easy for users anywhere in the world to stay informed and entertained.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience working with REST APIs, parsing JSON data, writing modular functions, and designing a user-friendly CLI application. It also introduced me to basic time zone calculations and error handling techniques for real-world scenarios like timeouts or API failures.

The app is designed to be both lightweight and educational ‚Äî perfect for Python beginners or anyone interested in combining weather data with personalized activity recommendations. It‚Äôs also structured for testability and clarity, making it a solid example of beginner-to-intermediate Python programming.

## Features
- Uses Open-Meteo's Geocoding & Weather APIs
- Maps weather codes to simplified conditions like "Clear", "Rain", "Snow"
- Suggests indoor or outdoor activities based on the weather
- Approximates local time using the formula: `longitude / 15`

## Project Structure
- `project.py`: Main program containing all functions and the main entry point
- `test_project.py`: Tests for core functions (`suggest_activities`, `get_local_time_utc`, and `WEATHER_CODES`)
- `requirements.txt`: Lists external Python dependencies (`requests`)

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the app:
   python project.py
